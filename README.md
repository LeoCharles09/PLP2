1. Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Fundamentals concepts of Version Control:
a) Tracking Changes- records modifications made to files including who did the modifications and when.
b) Branching and Merging- Allows one to create branches so as to work on different features or fixes independently and ends up merging them back into the main ptoject.
c) Collaboration- Multiple people can work on the same project together/simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
d) Back up and restore- one can go back to previous versions if something goes wrong, so as to ensuring you don't loose important work.
Why GitHub is Popular
a) Collaboration: GitHub makes it easy for developers to collaborate on projects with some  features like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking there as making work easier for them.
b) Hosting and Sharing: It provides a central place to host repositories, making it easy to share code and contribute to open-source projects to everyone so as to gain assistance and more ideas.
c) Community and Resources: It has a large community of developers allover the world and extensive resources that will come in hand while programming.
Maintaining Project Integrity with Version Control
a) Preventing Conflicts while working on Projects: By managing changes in separate branches, it minimizes the risk of conflicts and makes it easier to integrate changes while using it.
b) Accountability of work: Every change is recorded with details about who made it and why, providing a clear trail thus making work easier and enjoyable.
c) Consistency in working: Ensures that everyone on the team is working with the same version of the project, reducing errors due to outdated or inconsistent files that may end up leading to inconsistent workflow.
d) Recovery: If a mistake is made, you can easily revert to a previous version, ensuring that valuable work isnâ€™t lost thus making it easier to restore data and to make amendments where necessary.
3. Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps, and what are some of the important decisions you must make during this process?

4. Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?

5. Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

6. Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?

7. How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

8. Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

9. Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

10. Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

11. Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
